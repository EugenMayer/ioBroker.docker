### Report an issue or request a feature

If you found an issue or missing some feature please let us know by opening an [GitHub issue](https://github.com/buanet/ioBroker.docker/issues).

## Important notice

In general a new major version (e.g. v2, v4, v5) of the image comes with a new, preinstalled major node version!
If you are updating an existing installation to a new major version (e.g. from v4 to v5) you have to perform some additional steps inside ioBroker! For more details please see official ioBroker documentation: [EN](https://www.iobroker.net/#en/documentation/install/updatenode.md) | [DE](https://www.iobroker.net/#de/documentation/install/updatenode.md).<br>

You might avoid these procedure if you use my "Best practice" hint for "upgrading your ioBroker container".

In any case make a backup first!
